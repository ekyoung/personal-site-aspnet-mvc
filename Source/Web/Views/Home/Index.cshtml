    <h1>Ethan Young</h1>
    <p>
        I built this site mostly as a hobby. Yes, I am a big enough nerd to want to build a website on the weekends for fun.

        <p>
            This section contains pictures from some of the trips I've taken. Most of them involve skiing and motorcycle touring: my two main hobbies.

            I'm selling a couple shirts at Cafe Press. Check 'em out, then buy one.

        <p>
            I'm a software developer specializing in .NET web development. I'll keep my resume up to date when I'm actively looking for a job,
            but it may get out of date when I'm only passively looking.
