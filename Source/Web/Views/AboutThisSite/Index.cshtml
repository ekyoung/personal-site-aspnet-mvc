<h1>About This Site</h1>
<h3>
    ASP.NET MVC 5
</h3>
<p>
    This site is built from a .NET MVC 5 Web Project. I started it as a Web Site Project when
    Visual Studio first introduced those. I didn't like it and converted it to a Web Application Project.
    Recently I converted it to MVC as an opportunity to add one more tool to my toolbelt.
</p>
<h3>
    Angular JS
</h3>
<p>
    The image galleries and  slide shows in the <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Trips")">trips</a> portion
    of the site use <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular JS</a>. The images are
    all deployed to a separate domain. Each collection of images also contains an index file with titles,
    the date the picture was taken, and a few descriptions. An <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular JS</a>
    controller loads the index file using $http and builds the list of images, or the slide show view client side.
</p>
<h3>
    Bootstrap
</h3>
<p>
    Using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> made the styling of this site super easy.
    I used some of the responsive features of the framework in the <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Trips")">trips</a> portion
    of the site to hide the left nav on smaller devices. Since I'm not a graphic designer (and I'm colorblind), I used
    the Flatly theme from <a href="http://bootswatch.com" target="_blank">Bootswatch</a> for the look and feel.

<h3>
    Automated Testing
</h3>
<p>
    Unit tests for the image collection index editing app are implemented in <a href="http://www.nunit.org/" target="_blank">NUnit</a>.
    Acceptance tests are implemented in <a href="http://www.specflow.org/" target="_blank">SpecFlow</a>.
    <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> runs these with every commit. There are no
    tests for the server side portion of the website because all the dynamic behavior is implemented with
    <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular JS</a> on the client side. The <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular JS</a>
    code is tested with <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io" target="_blank">Karma</a>.
